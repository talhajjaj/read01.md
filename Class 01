React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

to use the react you should have some knowlodege in HTML and JavaScript , because you wil use let ,const and class and alot of javascript features. 

the components uses to tell react what the user want to see on the screen , when you change the data. 
and it takes in parameters , called props (properties) .
The render method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen. React developers use a special syntax called “JSX” because it makes  the structures easier to write.

JSX comes with the full power of JavaScript. You can put any JavaScript expressions within braces inside JSX. Each React element is a JavaScript object that you can store in a variable or pass around in your program.

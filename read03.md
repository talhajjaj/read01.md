HTML5 introduces new set of elements thats allow you to divide up the parts of a page.

The <nav> element is used blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.

a container for any section of a
page , we can wrote in it a paragraph or put a img .

The <section> element groups related content together, and
typically each section would have its own heading.

# Extra Markup

in this part we talk about modeling and how to make your web page attractive , its by adding a images and for sure you can add a images in html .
but first of all you should pick afittings image to your project ,  and show an image at the right size.

so lets see how we can do it ?

<img src="images.jpg" alt="about the image"

<img> elements mean add image to this page.
<src> This tells the browser where
it can find the image file, you can go to google and search for 
the image that you want the copy address then past in html .

and the <alt> This provides a text description
of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.

and you can controlthe size and choose the height,
width in pixels.

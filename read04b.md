**How Computers Work:**
computers is in everywhere its in people pockets, in there cars.
so first step we should take is learning how computers work?
or whats make it a computer?
so in these vedios it telling us How did the computer evolve and start doing many tasks?

at the beginning computer was made out of wood and metal , and it was very large it take a room size , it was slowly and take hours just to do a basic math problem .
computers started out as basic calculaters and handling with numbers only .
but nowdays we can carry it and use it to connect with each other ,playing games ....

but the common thing between the old computer and all computer is these four  things : Input, store information, process it , output (*the result* ) 

- Input :
its the things that you or someone do to makes the computer do stuff.
by controling the keyboard ,mouse ,a touch screen it can sense your finger and it takes your finger as input .

- store information :
a computer process takes info from the memory , it changes using algorithm; which is just a series of command ,and then it send the process info back to be stored in memory again, its continue until the processed info is ready to be output 

- output :
the output is the final result , a text , photo, vedio games ....
and when computer connect to the internet the output from one computer become the input to another .

so we all know that computers work on ones and zero , 0101010101 its do play truly in how computer work inside , the inside coputer there is a electric wires and circuits that store the info
so how do you store info using electricity? 
with one wire we can represent a yes or no , or any thing that have two options .
every word or image you see on the web page is represented using a system like this.

the computer is Consists the *hardware* and *software*
hardware is the wires,chips ,keyboard, plugs..
software is all computer programs thats running inside the computer its can be apps and games .
so the software and hardware is interact to each other so its became a computer .

**How Computers Work:**
computers is in everywhere its in people pockets, in there cars.
so first step we should take is learning how computers work?
or whats make it a computer?
so in these vedios it telling us How did the computer evolve and start doing many tasks?

at the beginning computer was made out of wood and metal , and it was very large it take a room size , it was slowly and take hours just to do a basic math problem .
computers started out as basic calculaters and handling with numbers only .
but nowdays we can carry it and use it to connect with each other ,playing games ....

but the common thing between the old computer and all computer is these four  things : Input, store information, process it , output (*the result* ) 

- Input :
its the things that you or someone do to makes the computer do stuff.
by controling the keyboard ,mouse ,a touch screen it can sense your finger and it takes your finger as input .

- store information :
a computer process takes info from the memory , it changes using algorithm; which is just a series of command ,and then it send the process info back to be stored in memory again, its continue until the processed info is ready to be output 

- output :
the output is the final result , a text , photo, vedio games ....
and when computer connect to the internet the output from one computer become the input to another .

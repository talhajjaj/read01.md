**Comparison and logical operators:**
comparing between values ,the result will be a boolean :T or F
- first s is **equal to** == ,
it used to comparis between two values to see if they are the same!
>example :
"welcome"=="hi" 
its will give us false because its not the same .

- **strict equal** === ,
it used to comparis two values to see if data type and value are the same !
>example:
'6'===6 
it will returns false because they are not the same value or type .

- **not equal** != ,
it used to comparis between two values to see if they aren't the same!
>example:
'welcome'!='hi' 
it will give us true.

- **strict not equal ** !== ,
it used to comparis two values to see if data type and value aren't the same !
>example:
'6'!==6 
it will returns true because they arent the same .

**logical operators**
logical opreators allow you to compare the  results of more than one Comparison operator. to expression which true or false.
the logical operators is: 
- logical and *&&* ,,:
these operator test more than one condition .
if the two condition is true then it will be true .
if any of the condition is false then it will returnsto false.

- logical or || ,, :
this operator test at least one condition.
if any of the condition is true it will returns to true .
but if the both is false then it will returns to false .

- logical Not ! ,,:
these operator takes single boolean value and inverst it.
its make the false true and the true false .
!true returns false
! false returns true


***for and while loops***

Loops : its to check a condition, if it true it will returns until it returns false so it will out of the loop .
there are three types of loops :
- for :  its used for codes number , if you know how many the code should run use it.so when condition is no longer true , the loops end . the script will move to the next line .
>its the most common loop

- while : if you dont know how many the code should run use this while loop , it will continue looping untile it returns false.

so when condition is no longer true , the loops end . the script will move to the next line .

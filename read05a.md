how adding images?
 to add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element It must carry the ,following two attributes:
src:
This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image .
alt : to descripe text of image .

you can control of width and height ,by adding the height and width to the <img src "" height="" width"" > 
height: is this specifies the height of the image in pixels.
width: is this specifies the width of the image in pixels.
so where you gonna put the image is really matter ,you can put it before a paragraph ,inside the start of a paragraph or in the middle of a paragraph.
we can use elign element to  indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image it can be on left or right on the top , middle or bottom. and you added it to the code <img src "" elign=>.

Three rules for creating images:

- The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms of a mix of red, green, and blue .
Contrast, when picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.
- low contrast :text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and foreground colors.
- High contrast : Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast between background and foreground colors.
-Medium contrast: For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability.

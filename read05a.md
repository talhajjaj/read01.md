how adding images?
 to add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element It must carry the ,following two attributes:
src:
This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image .
alt : to descripe text of image .

you can control of width and height ,by adding the height and width to the <img src "" height="" width"" > 
height: is this specifies the height of the image in pixels.
width: is this specifies the width of the image in pixels.
so where you gonna put the image is really matter ,you can put it before a paragraph ,inside the start of a paragraph or in the middle of a paragraph.
we can use elign element to  indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image it can be on left or right on the top , middle or bottom. and you added it to the code <img src "" elign=>.

Three rules for creating images:
- Save images in the right format.
- Save images at the right size.
- Use the correct resolution.
you can insert animated gifs to your page ,animated GIFs show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.

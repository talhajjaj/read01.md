If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses, you should store it on your computer .
how adding images?
 to add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element It must carry the ,following two attributes:
src:
This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image .
alt : to descripe text of image .

you can control of width and height ,by adding the height and width to the <img src "" height="" width"" > 
height: is this specifies the height of the image in pixels.
width: is this specifies the width of the image in pixels.
so where you gonna put the image is really matter ,you can put it before a paragraph ,inside the start of a paragraph or in the middle of a paragraph.
we can use elign element to  indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image it can be on left or right on the top , middle or bottom. and you added it to the code <img src "" elign=>.

Three rules for creating images:
- Save images in the right format.
- Save images at the right size.
- Use the correct resolution.
you can insert animated gifs to your page ,animated GIFs show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.


**color**:
colors will bring life to your page ,
Foreground color;
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element.
Background-color;You can specify your choice of background color,by default, most browser windows have a white background.
- every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.
- The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms of a mix of red, green, and blue .
Contrast, when picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.
- low contrast :text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and foreground colors.
- High contrast : Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast between background and foreground colors.
-Medium contrast: For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability.

**Layout:**


how to creat attractive page layouts , 
key concepts in postining elements
building blocks
css treats each HTML elemnts as if it is in its own box.the box will be inline box or a block level , Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks
of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text.
Block level elements examples: <h1> <p> <ul> <li>
.

inline elements: <img> <b>.
if one block level element sits inside another block level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
controlling the position of elements: 

there is three ways to use the property in CSS;

- Normal flow : Every block-level element
appears on a new line.

- Relative positionig ; This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed.
- Absolute positioning:
This positions the element in relation to its containing element.

we can use box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom ..
- Fixed positioning : 
This is a form of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window, as opposed to the containing element.
Floating elements;

- Floating an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position
it to the far left or right of a containing box.
clearing floats : the clear property allows you
to say that no element (within the same containing element) should touch the left or righthand sides of a box.
creating multi columnm layouts with floats:
there is many properties are used to position the columns :
width ;to sets the width of the columns .
float : to make columns next to each other .
margin : to creat gap between columns .

**screen size :**
 your site will have different sized screens that show
different amounts of information,so your design needs to be able to work on ,the size of a user's screen affects how big they can open
their windows and how much of the page they will see.

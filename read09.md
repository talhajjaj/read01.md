**Choosing a Text Editor** :

it's not matters as to which text editor you use. 
some text editing software comes with features that other text editing
software does not. But for the most part, they’re all pretty similar.

it is the one that you enjoy using the most. That’s really the best one.

so What is a text editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser,that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site.

most *important features* in text editor are: 
- code completion .
- syntax highlighting.
- a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
- the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them. 

*and Another nice feature* is being able to write your **HTML** and **CSS** more
efficiently. There is a kind of shorthand language called **Emmet** that can help. Emmet will speed up your code writing faster than you can imagine.

*Another feature* you should definitely look into is called syntax
highlighting. Syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you
type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. 
A text editor that has a great selection of extension will ensure that you have the ability to add functionality as you need.

different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.

**Images :**
did you know that you can control the size of images ? 

you can change it by using the length and width property in css.

First you need to determine the sizes of images that will be used
commonly throughout the site, then give each size a name. For example:

- small
- medium
- large.

Where the img elements appear in the HTML, rather  than using width and height attributes you can use these names as values for the class
attribute. In the CSS, you add selectors for each of the class names, then use the CSS width and height properties to control the image dimensions.

centering images :

first of all , you should turn it to a block elemnt so you can put it in center.
you can use the text-align property with a value of center.
on the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto. you can specify class names that allow any element to be centered, in the same way that you can for the dimensions or alignment of images.

Back ground images:
 
background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.
you can add it to your web by using css;

p { 
  background-image: url("");},


   you can control background position property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed.
   second represents the vertical.

   you can control the position as making it ;

left top

left center

left bottom

center top

center center

center bottom

right top

right bottom.

The background property acts like a shorthand for all of the other background properties you have just seen, and also the background-color property.

background-color.

background-image. 

background-repeat

background-attachment

background-position.

**Practical Information :**

Search engine optimization is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.

on page seo;
there are seven key places it can appear in order to improve its findability.

1- Page title;
The page title appears at the top of the browser window or on the tab of a browser. It is specified in the title element which lives inside the head element.

 2- Web Address;
The name of the file is part of the URL. Where possible, use keywords in the file name.

3-  Headings;
If the keywords are in a heading element then a search engine will know that this page is all about that subject and give it greater weight than other text.

4- Text;
Where possible, it helps to repeat the keywords in the main
body of the text at least 2-3 times. Do not, however, over-use
these terms, because the text must be easy for a human to read.


5- Link Text;

Use keywords in the text that create links between pages.

6- Image Alt Text;
Search engines rely on you providing accurate descriptions of images in the alt text. This will also help your images show up in the results of image-based searches.

7- Page Descriptions; 

The description also lives inside
the head element and is specified using a meta tag. It should be a sentence that describes the content of the page.

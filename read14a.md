transform ; 
property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.
 
the value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses, transform  includes multiple vendor prefixes to gain the best support across all browsers. 

**2D Transforms**
- 2D rotate,
The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise.

- 2D Scale 

  scale value it allows you to change the appeared size of an element. The default scale value is 1, therefore any value between .99

- 2D Translate,
value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document.

**Transitions & Animations**

Transitions;

The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the( 
:hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes).

all of the properties within an elementâ€™s different states will be altered upon change,It is important to note, not all properties may be transitioned, only properties that have an identifiable halfway point. Colors, font sizes, and the alike may be transitioned from one value to another.

Transition Delay;

On top of declaring the transition property, duration, and timing function, you can also set a delay with the transition-delay property. The delay sets a time value, seconds or milliseconds.

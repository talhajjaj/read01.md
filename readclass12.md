**Mongo and Mongoose**

- Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL:
1. SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS).
2. SQL databases are table based databases.

3. SQL databases have predefined schema .
4. SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases
NoSQL:
1. NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
2.  NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.
3. NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
 4. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable


- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
For the type of data to be stored: SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage.

-Give a real world example.


 MS-SQL Server Express Edition
It is a powerful and user friendly database which has good stability, reliability and scalability with support from Microsoft. The following are some of MS-SQL benefits and strengths:
 1. Integrated Development Environment
 2. Disaster Recovery
 3. Cloud back-up


 -  What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set


- Give a real world example.
. MongoDB
Mongodb is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents. It is non-relational database with dynamic schema. It has been developed by the founders of DoubleClick, written in C++ and is currently being used by some big companies like The New York Times, Craigslist, MTV Networks.


- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage

-Which type of database is best for scalability?
NoSQL


**sql vs nosql**

- What does SQL stand for?
Structured query language
- What is a realational database?
It’s a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.


- What type of structure does a relational database work with?
Logical database.
- What is a ‘schema’?
it is refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed.
- What is a NoSQL database?
 NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
- Howo does it work? its work dynamically.
- What is inside of a Mongo database? it contain alot of data in very efficint way.
- Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

mongoDB is more flexible,
you can have different documents in one 
- What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
1. NoSQL databases don’t have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don’t support ACID).
2. NoSQL is not compatible (at all) with SQL

3. NoSQL are very new compared to Relational Databases, which means that are far less stable and may have a lot less functionalities.

 **NODE.JS**

 - An Introduction to Node;


 1. What is node.js?
is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine

3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript run-time for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

4. What is npm?
Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm,in addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry.

5. What version of node are you running on your machine?
v12.22.1
6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?
6.14.12

7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
npm install -g jshint

8. What is node used for?
Node uses the libuv library to implement this asynchronous (that is, non-blocking) behavior.


** 6 Reasons for Pair Programming;**

3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness


2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
i think Engaged collaboration and Learning from fellow students

3. How does pair programming work?
 pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. 
 The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. 
 Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control
 and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation,
but should not be writing any code.
